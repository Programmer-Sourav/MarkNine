# MarkNine
Mark Nine assignment

A food recommendation app built using ReactJS that can display the foods of different categories - (markNine)

Technologies used: React js, html, css

*** I was not able to make the reactjs app live on netlify... I tried a few times but probably I was doing some mistake.. So, I added the live link to repl.it
